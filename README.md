## Description

That's my own blog. Here I'll be able to share with you my opinion about something, a strange point of view, useful facts and interesting moments. 
The project was completely built using Django technologies, PostgreSQL database and AWS S3 statistical data storage space.  
Deployed on https://news-habuu.ondigitalocean.app

## Requirements

Project are using next technologies:
* Django 4.0.1
* Pillow 9.0.0
* django-simple-captcha 0.5.14 
* django-debug-toolbar 3.2.4


## Recommended modules
* psycopg2 2.9.3
* dj-database-url 0.5.0
* boto3 1.20.45
* django-storages 1.12.3
* django-ckeditor 6.2.0

## Installation & Configuration

Before installing process, you have to be sure that Python and Git are installed on your device.
```shell
~$ mkdir temp && cd temp
~$ git clone <repo-name>.git
~$ cd mysite/
~$ python -m venv djangoenv
```
If you use package manager PIP try:
```shell
~$ source djangoenv/bin/activate
~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now lets configure a little bit our project: You have to create DB into your local PostgresSQL and configure environment variables. Also you could use sqlite DB ( fast run). For this, please overwrite DATABASE variable in settings.py
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```
Now you must setting other environment variables DEBUG
```shell
~$ export DEBUG=True;DEVELOPMENT_MODE=True
```
For using default Django's staticfiles manager, please comment this line into settings.py
```python
from .cdn.conf import *  # comment this
```
Notice, functions that depend on E-Mail SMTP won't be work. So let's complete our installation.
```shell
~$ python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
~$ python manage.py createsuperuser # and follow the instructions//
~$ python manage.py runserver
```
Warning! If you've got some troubles with django-debug-toolbar you should install this module or remove its from django settings.py and urls.py
